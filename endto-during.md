## Implementing Your Study

If you [planned your study well](endto-before.md), then the procedures to recruit participants, inform them about the study, and obtain their consent should be clear and easy to follow during data colletion. Equally, it is important that researchers are prepared to respond to different situations during data collection, where often they need to make decisions on their own and without input from the rest of the team. This is especially true for fieldwork overseas or in remote communities. 

### **Training your research staff & students**

All researchers involved in a research project should be trained well in research ethics and why certain protocols are being implemented. Taking research ethics and/or data privacy courses offered by your organization or referring them to this ethics course are good places to start. Researchers should also be briefed about the specific study protocols and materials to be used. Also think about soft skills expected from a researcher, such as how to communicate with participants professionally and what to do when something unexpected happens. Having well-informed and confident researchers doing data collection is important to the success of any research project.

#### How this supports the BPS ethics principles of _scientific integrity_ and _social responsibility_
A good research plan is nothing if the implementation is very poor. Researchers must possess the necessary skills so that they can carry out the research according to what was intended. At the very least, researchers must be aware when a situation calls for decision-making that is beyond their capability or level of authority so that they can seek help from their peers, seniors, or from members of their organization.

### Ongoing consent and renewal of consent

Some research designs require multiple sessions or working with participants for an extended period of time (e.g., weeks, months, or years). In this case, it is essential that participants have the opportunity to express continued consent to participate in the study, that they are reminded of their rights as participants, and that they know who to contact if there are any issues that cannot be resolved by the research team.

#### How this supports the BPS ethics principle of _respect_
Consent is an ongoing process. Even if a participant agreed to participate in the study at first, they are free to change their minds at any time. They may realize that the research study requires a certain amount of time or effort that they could not or do not want to give anymore. They do not have to feel obligated to keep participating in the study. They are also not required to explain why they want to withdraw from a study. A responsible researcher respects this right and acknowledges that all research participation is voluntary.
