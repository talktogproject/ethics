## Implementing Your Study

If you [planned your study well](endto-before.md), then the procedures to recruit participants, inform them about the study, and obtain their consent should be clear and easy to follow during data colletion. Equally, it is important that researchers are prepared to respond to different situations during data collection, where often they need to make decisions on their own and without input from the rest of the team. This is especially true for fieldwork overseas or in remote communities. 

### **Training your research staff & students**

All researchers involved in a research project should be adequately trained in research ethics and why certain protocols are being implemented. Taking research ethics and/or data privacy courses offered by your organization or referring them to this ethics course are good places to start. Also think about soft skills expected from a researcher, such as how to communicate with participants professionally and what to do when something unexpected happens.
