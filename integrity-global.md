## Ethics Dumping

International research collaborations can lead to a meaningful exchange of knowledge and skills. However, collaborations between institutions in the so-called Global North and the Global South can also be inequitable, or worse, exploitative.

> Ethics dumping occurs mainly in two areas. First, when research participants and/or resources in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are exploited intentionally, for instance because research can be undertaken in an LMIC that would be prohibited in a high-income country. Second, exploitation can occur due toinsufficient ethics awareness on the part of the researcher, or low research gover-nance capacity in the host nation. (p. 2)
