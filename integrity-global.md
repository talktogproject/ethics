## International Collaborations and Ethics Dumping

International research collaborations, on the one hand, can lead to a meaningful exchange of knowledge and skills between partners. On the other hand, partnerships between institutions in the so-called Global North and the Global South can also be inequitable, or worse, exploitative.

There is a risk of 'ethics dumping' or exporting unethical ethics practices to low- to middle-income countries.

> Ethics dumping occurs mainly in two areas. First, when research participants and/or resources in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are exploited intentionally, for instance because research can be undertaken in an LMIC that would be prohibited in a high-income country. Second, exploitation can occur due to insufficient ethics awareness on the part of the researcher, or low research gover-nance capacity in the host nation. (p. 2)

[Many prominent examples come from health and biological research](https://theconversation.com/ethics-dumping-the-dark-side-of-international-research-88675); however, The Guardian provides [some examples that are also relevant to education and social sciences research](https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/aug/31/ethics-dumping-the-exploitative-side-of-academic-research):

* Avoiding local ethics approval
* Lack of awareness about the community, e.g., not contacting community leaders prior to a study
* Insensitive behaviour, e.g., entering indigenous people's homes and taking pictures without consent
* 'Extractive' research, e.g. not sharing benefits of the study or knowledge gained with the community

The [Global Code of Conduct](https://www.globalcodeofconduct.org/) was established to counter ethics dumping and to promote highly equitable partnerships between high-income and low- to middle-income countries around the world. The code of conduct has 4 main principles; namely:

* Fairness

* Respect

* Care

* Honesty
