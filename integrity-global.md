## International Collaborations and Ethics Dumping

International research collaborations, on the one hand, can lead to a meaningful exchange of knowledge and skills between partners. On the other hand, partnerships between institutions in the so-called Global North and the Global South can also be inequitable, or worse, exploitative.

There is a risk of 'ethics dumping' or exporting unethical ethics practices to low- to middle-income countries.

> Ethics dumping occurs mainly in two areas. First, when research participants and/or resources in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are exploited intentionally, for instance because research can be undertaken in an LMIC that would be prohibited in a high-income country. Second, exploitation can occur due to insufficient ethics awareness on the part of the researcher, or low research gover-nance capacity in the host nation. (p. 2)

[Many prominent examples come from health and biological research](https://theconversation.com/ethics-dumping-the-dark-side-of-international-research-88675); however, The Guardian provides [some examples that are also relevant to education and social sciences research](https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/aug/31/ethics-dumping-the-exploitative-side-of-academic-research):

* Avoiding local ethics approval
* Lack of awareness about the community, e.g., not contacting community leaders prior to a study
* Insensitive behaviour, e.g., entering indigenous people's homes and taking pictures without consent
* 'Extractive' research, e.g. not sharing benefits of the study or knowledge gained with the community

The [Global Code of Conduct](https://www.globalcodeofconduct.org/) was established to counter ethics dumping and to promote highly equitable partnerships between high-income and low- to middle-income countries around the world. The code of conduct has 4 main principles; namely:

### 1. **Fairness**
- collaborating with local communities on issues that are relevant to them
- involving researchers throughout the entire research process wherever possible, including in sharing data, intellectual property, and authorship of publications
- fair compensation of local staff and contributors, e.g. translators, interpreters, & local coordinators<br/ >
### 2. **Respect**
- being sensitive local cultural contexts and practices
- obtaining local community assent and working with existing community structures
- seeking approval from local research ethics committees and showing respect to these committees, even when ethics from a high-income setting has already been obtained<br/ >
### 3. **Care**
- procedures for obtaining consent and raising feedback and complaints must be accessible, easy to understand, and agreed upon with the local communities
- no double standard: if research would be restricted or prohibited in a high-income setting, then this should not be carried out in a low- to middle-income setting either
- potential risks to the participants (e.g., stigmatization) and researchers (e.g., security), or potential burdens on local resources (e.g., local staff) should be discussed with local partners<br/ >
### 4. **Honesty**
- clear roles, responsibilities, and conduct should be established with all parties involved in the research; capacity-building for local researchers must be part of the discussion
- researchers must be clear and transparent in their communication, using plain, non-patronizing language, and without withholding any information
- researchers must not accept or support any form of corruption or bribery
- maintain high standards of data privacy even when local standards or procedures may be lower


As you can see, the research community has done a great deal to establish what we must expect from each other as researchers, wherever we are in the world. In the next section, we will take a closer look at how ethics is applied to every stage of the research process.
