### Questionable Research Practices

There are research practices that fall into a gray area. Questionable research practices (QRPs) are neither deliberate acts of research misconduct nor completely acceptable in research. 

Whereas a meta-analysis found that an estimated 2% of researchers admitted to engaging in serious research misconduct, [more than 30% have reported engaging in questionable research practices](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005738). The numbers are greater when reporting on colleagues' misconduct (14%) or QRPs (over 70%).
