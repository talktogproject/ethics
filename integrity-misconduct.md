## Research misconduct

According to the [Concordat for Research Integrity](https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Documents/2012/the-concordat-to-support-research-integrity-2012.pdf), research misconduct is:

> "characterised as behaviour or actions that fall short of the standards of ethics, research and scholarship required to ensure that the integrity of research is upheld."

Examples of research misconduct include:

### **Data fabrication or falsification**

In an infamous case of scientific fraud, a social psychologist published papers using [datasets that were made up or modified to suit his research hypotheses](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2011/12/diederik-stapel). Many of his papers were retracted. A report also stated that the misconduct negatively affected the careers of colleagues and graduate students who published papers with him.

### **Plagiarism**

[According to the APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/plagiarism), plagiarism "is the act of presenting the words, ideas, or images of another as your own; it denies authors or creators of content the credit they are due". An example is failing to cite the original article where a quote, idea, or image was first published. This also includes self-plagiarism; for example, if an author publishes the same study in two different journals. There may be grey areas and acceptable uses of previous work, such as minor citation errors and students who publish peer-reviewed articles based on their thesis work. [Go to the APA Style website for more information about plagiarism](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/plagiarism).

### **Undisclosed conflicts of interest**

Here is an example of a conflict of interest from the [Research Support office at The University of Oxford](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/governance/integrity/conflict/examples):

> A researcher holds a position (for example as a director) in an enterprise that may wish to restrict or otherwise manage adverse research findings for commercial reasons."

Let's say that a researcher co-owns a company that sells educational products designed to improve children's learning outcomes. The researcher then publishes a study wherein she evaluated the effectiveness of using these products. This study may be perceived as less trustworthy because the researcher has a financial incentive for showing that the product works. In this case, the conflict of interest should be [declared, managed, or avoided by the researcher](https://www.hra.nhs.uk/media/documents/nreap04-guidance-national-research-ethics-advisors-panel-13-february-2012.pdf).

### **'Gift' or 'ghost' authorships**

This article from [Nature Index](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/gift-ghost-authorship-what-researchers-need-to-know) describes instances wherein a co-author was added to the publication list even when they had little to no contribution to the work, e.g., due to the co-author's senior position in an institution or as a way to boost a researcher's publication record. On the other hand, ghost authors are those who substantially contributed to the work but were excluded from gaining credit. [Journal publishers](https://www.nature.com/nature-research/editorial-policies/authorship) and [universities](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/governance/integrity/publication#collapse1310156) have published guidelines to clarify what counts as authorship in research work.

### **Lapses from accepted research practices or protocols**

Research studies involving human participants follow protocols to ensure that participants know that they are joining a study, what the study is about, and what will happen to the information that they will provide. Disregard for protocol may result in research misconduct; for example, if a researcher shares sensitive information about research participants (e.g., identifying information, health conditions) to a third party (e.g., a government organization, a researcher from another research group/organization), or if participants are recruited without going through the appropriate consent procedures (e.g., a child in a community is tested on the spot without written or oral consent from a parent or caregiver). We will go into more detail in Sections 2 and 3.  

### **Improper dealing with misconduct allegations**

These involve attempts by individuals or institutions to cover-up research misconduct or silence whistleblowers. Knowing the true extent of research misconduct in research is difficult. Naturally, very few researchers [admit to committing research misconduct themselves](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005738) and [complete and transparent reporting of misconduct investigations remains elusive, at least in the UK](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05697-7).

## Serious Misconduct vs. Questionable Research Practices

Serious research misconduct, such as data fabrication, may be clear-cut. However, many unacceptable research practices often fall into the grey area of questionable research practices (QRPs). Whereas a meta-analysis found that an estimated 2% of researchers admitted to engaging in serious research misconduct, [more than 30% have reported engaging in questionable research practices](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005738). The numbers are greater when reporting on colleagues' misconduct (14%) or QRPs (over 70%). 

Behaviours that have been classified by some authors [[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%252FPL00022268), [2](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797611430953?casa_token=6ZCAk1BdpFQAAAAA%3AFMVg1J6IAA-PbzLzBwzLBc3-Xx4BH_uXxugsF5DNNSaQv8RA3lZJSIB1N3OzgRfxC3X2ZJ2MHPc)] under questionable research practices include:

* Inflating one's research record by listing papers as 'in press' when they have not yet been accepted in a journal
* Inaccurate research summaries in abstracts or inadequate reporting of research methods (e.g., failing to report all research conditions or study variables)
* [p-hacking](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002106#sec001) or the selective reporting of variables, data points, or statistical analyses with significant results

Research misconduct and questionable research practices [lead to a number of consequences](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%252FPL00022268); such as wasting research funding, decreasing the trustworthiness of research, researchers, and research institutions, and in the case of child research, perhaps misdirecting policy decisions and future public funding.

Currently, there are great initiatives to improve transparency and accuracy in research, such as [pre-registration](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg), [registered reports](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports), and [the open sharing of data sets and research materials](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/badges). These open science practices are increasingly being adopted with the aim to make research more rigorous and trustworthy.
