## Research misconduct

According to the [Concordat for Research Integrity](https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Documents/2012/the-concordat-to-support-research-integrity-2012.pdf), research misconduct is:

> characterised as behaviour or actions that fall short of the standards of ethics, research and scholarship required to ensure that the integrity of research is upheld.

Examples of research misconduct are:

* Data fabrication, falsification, or misrepresentation

> In an infamous case of scientific fraud, a social psychologist published papers using [data that he claimed he collected, but were suspected to be entirely made up or modified to conform to his hypotheses](https://web.archive.org/web/20160627142859/https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/upload/547aa461-6cd1-48cd-801b-61c434a73f79_interim-report.pdf). Many papers had been retracted, and a report stated that the misconduct had negatively affected the careers of colleagues and PhD students who published with him.

* Plagiarism

> [According to the APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/plagiarism), plagiarism "is the act of presenting the words, ideas, or images of another as your own; it denies authors or creators of content the credit they are due". An example is failing to cite the original article where a quote, idea, or image was first published. This also incldues self-plagiarism; for example, if an author publishes the same study in two different journals. There may be gray areas, such as minor citation errors, and students who publish peer-reviewed articles based on their thesis work. [Go to the APA Style website for more information](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/plagiarism).

• failure to meet ethical, legal and professional obligations:for example failure to declare competing interests; misrepresentation of involvement or authorship; misrepresentation of interests; breach of confidentiality; lack of informed consent; misuse of personal data; and abuse of research subjects or materials

• improper dealing with allegations of misconduct:failing to address possible infringements such as attempts to cover up misconduct and reprisals against whistleblowers




How widespread is the problem? It is hard to give an exact estimate. Naturally, few researchers would [admit to committing research misconduct](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-39357819) and [complete and transparent reporting remains elusive, at least in the UK](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05697-7).

Research misconduct does not only occur because of clearly malicious and devious intent. At times, 

Mistakes and lapses happen in research projects. What matters is how you respond when they occur. It is always best to be honest, transparent, and accountable.

For collaborations between researchers in the Global North and Global South, it’s especially important to ensure that research is done equitably between partners
