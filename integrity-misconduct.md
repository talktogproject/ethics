* Data fabrication/falsification/misrepresentation
* Intellectual property violations (e.g. plagiarism)
* Poor collaboration (e.g. authorship disputes)
* Undisclosed conflicts of interest

How widespread is the problem? It is hard to give an exact estimate. Naturally, few researchers would [admit to committing research misconduct](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-39357819) and [complete and transparent reporting remains elusive, at least in the UK](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05697-7).

Research misconduct does not only occur because of clearly malicious and devious intent. At times,
