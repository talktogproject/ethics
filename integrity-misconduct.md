## Research misconduct

According to the [Concordat for Research Integrity](https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Documents/2012/the-concordat-to-support-research-integrity-2012.pdf), research misconduct is:

> "characterised as behaviour or actions that fall short of the standards of ethics, research and scholarship required to ensure that the integrity of research is upheld."

Examples of research misconduct include:

* **Data fabrication, falsification, or misrepresentation**

In an infamous case of scientific fraud, a social psychologist published papers using [data that he claimed he collected, but were suspected to be made up or modified to conform to his hypotheses](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2011/12/diederik-stapel). Many papers had been retracted, and a report stated that the misconduct had negatively affected the careers of colleagues and graduate students who published with him.

* **Plagiarism**

[According to the APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/plagiarism), plagiarism "is the act of presenting the words, ideas, or images of another as your own; it denies authors or creators of content the credit they are due". An example is failing to cite the original article where a quote, idea, or image was first published. This also incldues self-plagiarism; for example, if an author publishes the same study in two different journals. There may be grey areas and acceptable uses of previous work, such as minor citation errors, and students who publish peer-reviewed articles based on their thesis work. [Go to the APA Style website for more information](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/plagiarism).

* **Undisclosed conflicts of interest**

Here is an example of a conflict of interest from the [Research Support office at The University of Oxford](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/governance/integrity/conflict/examples):

> A researcher holds a position (for example as a director) in an enterprise that may wish to restrict or otherwise manage adverse research findings for commercial reasons."

Let's say that a researcher co-owns a company that sells educational products designed to improve children's learning outcomes. The researcher then publishes a study wherein she evaluated the effectiveness of using these products. This study may be perceived as less objective or trustworthy because the researcher has a financial incentive for showing that the product works. In this case, the conflict of interest should be [declared, managed, or avoided by the researcher](https://www.hra.nhs.uk/media/documents/nreap04-guidance-national-research-ethics-advisors-panel-13-february-2012.pdf).

* **'Gift' or 'ghost' authorships**

This article from [Nature Index](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/gift-ghost-authorship-what-researchers-need-to-know) described instances when a co-author is added to the publication list even when they had little to no contribution to the work, e.g., due to the co-author's senior position in an institution or as a way to boost a researcher's CV. On the other hand, ghost authors are those who substantially contributed to the work but were excluded from gaining credit. [Journal publishers](https://www.nature.com/nature-research/editorial-policies/authorship) and [universities](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/governance/integrity/publication#collapse1310156) publish guidelines to clarify what counts as authorship in research work.

* **Confidentiality breaches, lack of consent, and personal data misuse**

Research studies involving human participants follow protocols to ensure that participants know that they are joining a study, what the study is about, and what will happen to the information that they will provide. Disregard for protocol may result in research misconduct; for example, if a researcher shares sensitive information about research participants (e.g., identifying information, health conditions) to a third party (e.g., a government organization, a researcher from another research group/organization), or if participants are recruited without going through the appropriate consent procedures (e.g., a child in a community is tested on the spot without written or oral consent from a parent or caregiver). We will go into more detail in Sections 2 and 3.  

* **Improper dealing with misconduct allegations**

These involve attempts by individuals or institutions to cover-up research misconduct or silence whistleblowers. Knowing the true extent of research misconduct in research is difficult. Naturally, very few researchers [admit to committing research misconduct themselves](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005738) and [complete and transparent reporting of misconduct investigations remains elusive, at least in the UK](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05697-7).
