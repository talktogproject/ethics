## Research misconduct

According to the [Concordat for Research Integrity](https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Documents/2012/the-concordat-to-support-research-integrity-2012.pdf), research misconduct is:

> "characterised as behaviour or actions that fall short of the standards of ethics, research and scholarship required to ensure that the integrity of research is upheld."

Examples of research misconduct are:

* Data fabrication, falsification, or misrepresentation

> In an infamous case of scientific fraud, a social psychologist published papers using [data that he claimed he collected, but were suspected to be entirely made up or modified (e.g., by changing participants' ratings) to conform to his hypotheses](https://web.archive.org/web/20160627142859/https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/upload/547aa461-6cd1-48cd-801b-61c434a73f79_interim-report.pdf). Many papers had been retracted, and a report stated that the misconduct had negatively affected the careers of colleagues and PhD students who published with him.

* Plagiarism

> [According to the APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/plagiarism), plagiarism "is the act of presenting the words, ideas, or images of another as your own; it denies authors or creators of content the credit they are due". An example is failing to cite the original article where a quote, idea, or image was first published. This also incldues self-plagiarism; for example, if an author publishes the same study in two different journals. There may be gray areas, such as minor citation errors, and students who publish peer-reviewed articles based on their thesis work. [Go to the APA Style website for more information](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/plagiarism).

* Undisclosed conflicts of interest

> Here is [an example of a conflict of interest](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/governance/integrity/conflict/examples#collapse405516) from the Research Support office at The University of Oxford:<br/><br />"A researcher holds a position (for example as a director) in an enterprise that may wish to restrict or otherwise manage adverse research findings for commercial reasons"<br /><br />A researcher should aim to declare, manage, and/or avoid a potential or perceived conflict of interest.

* 'Gift' or 'ghost' authorships

> This article from [Nature Index](https://www.natureindex.com/news-blog/gift-ghost-authorship-what-researchers-need-to-know) described instances when a co-author is added to the publication list even when they had little to no contribution to the work, e.g., due to the co-author's senior position in an institution or as a way to boost a researcher's CV. On the other hand, ghost authors are those who substantially contributed to the work but were excluded from gaining credit. [Journal publishers](https://www.nature.com/nature-research/editorial-policies/authorship) and [universities](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/governance/integrity/publication#collapse1310156) publish guidelines to clarify what counts as authorship in research work.

* Confidentiality breaches, lack of consent, and personal data misuse

> 

* Improper dealing of misconduct allegations

>

How widespread is the problem? It is hard to give an exact estimate. Naturally, few researchers would [admit to committing research misconduct](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-39357819) and [complete and transparent reporting remains elusive, at least in the UK](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05697-7).

Research misconduct does not only occur because of clearly malicious and devious intent. At times, 

Mistakes and lapses happen in research projects. What matters is how you respond when they occur. It is always best to be honest, transparent, and accountable.
