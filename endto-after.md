## Processing Your Data

As part of your research, you are probably creating, encoding, storing, analysing, and archiving data about individuals. This comes with the responsibility to maintain participants' privacy and to use data about them in a fair and responsible way. In the United Kingdom and the European Union, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) provides a legal framework for doing so. We will use GDPR-related terminology in this section; however, we think that researchers from non-EU countries can also think about how these regulations can be adopted for research in their own areas.

The kind of research that child researchers do often involves the processing of _personal data_.

> Personal data is information which relates to a living individual who can be identified from that information,  whether  directly  or  indirectly,  and  in  particular  by  reference  to  an  identifier. 

This includes a person's:
- name
- identification number
- location data
- online identifier (e.g., IP address)

The GPDR also considers certain types of data to be especially private and can expose participants to potential discrimination. These include data about a person's:
- racial or ethnic origin
- political opinions
- religious or philosophical beliefs
- membership in a trade union
- genetic or biometric data
- health
- sex life
- sexuality

Extra care is needed for these _special category personal data_.

### Anonymous and pseudonymous data

The purpose of anonymising datasets is to ensure that a participant cannot be re-identified based on the data they supply. Typically, researchers assign participant IDs and remove obvious identifiers such as names, addresses, and contact details from datasets to achieve this. While many researchers consider this to be enough to achieve participant anonymity, full anonymisation is actually difficult to achieve. We often collect additional data that makes it easier to trace data back to an individual, such as age, regional origin, and medical condition. In reality, most of the typical research practice is considered _pseudonymisation_, which is a way to disguise the participants' identities and make it a bit harder to retrace.

Some practices for responsible pseudonymisation:
- Make sure that datasets only contain participant IDs. The list linking participant IDs with participants' names and contact details must be kept separately.
- Store the list securely using password protection and/or by storing lists in locked cabinets.
- Do not share the above list with anyone outside the research team.

Audio or video recorded data present additional challenges. Participants might reveal personal information about themselves or other people during the recording. Additionally, participants' voices and faces make them more readily identifiable than pen and paper or questionnaire-based data collection methods. The CHILDES database lists [different levels of data access for audio and video data](https://talkbank.org/share/irb/options.html). This includes audio bleeping, video blurring, and the replacement of last names and addresses in transcripts. Importantly, research involving photo, audio, or video recordings should have consent forms that explicitly ask for participants' agreement for these recordings to be made and used for specified purposes. You can access a [sample template at the University of Oxford website](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/files/writtenconsentformtemplatedocx).

### Data protection principles

When processing personal data, it is important to adhere to the following data protection principles:

| Data protection principle | Description |
| -------|-------|
| Fair, lawful, and transparent data processing | Researchers must be clear about who will process or view their data, for what purpose(s) and for how long. Participants must also be aware of their right to withdraw consent at any time. |
| The data is collected for specific, explicit, and legitimate purposes | Personal data collected for a specific purpose should NOT be used for something else, unless there is consent for the new purpose. The use of personal data for other research is usually exempted from this principle. |
| The data collected and processed is no more than is necessary for the research | This discourages researchers from collecting more personal information than is necessary. Even within research teams, it is possible that not all members of the research team require access to the non-anonymised dataset to carry out their research duties. |
| Personal data is accurate and up-to-date (if needed) | Inaccurate data must be corrected or deleted without delay. Researchers are normally interested in a person's situation at a particular point in time; as such, there might be no need to update this information later on. |
| Identifiable data is destroyed when no longer needed | It is good practice to specify a suitable time when participant lists are destroyed, normally towards the end of the research project period. |
| Personal data is processed securely | Secure processing means that only authorised people can access and process personal data and within the scope of their duties, and that lost personal data can still be recovered if accidentally lost or destroyed. This means that there should be appropriate technological resources, organisational measures, and staff training in place for processing personal data securely. |

For collaborations that involve the sharing and transfer of data between different organizations, it is good practice to draw up a written agreement (called a 'data sharing agreement') to specify the roles and responsbilities of each organization in relation to data processing.

### Writing a research data management plan

Some grant applications require a research data management plan. Even if your institution, funding agency, or ethics committee do not require one, writing a data management plan is a good way to think about the type of data you're collecting, how they are organised, stored, archived, and shared, and what ethical and legal issues need to be considered. The Digital Curation Centre provides a [checklist for creating a data management plan for your project](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/resource/DMP/DMP_Checklist_2013.pdf).

### Some tips and tricks

- When planning your research, think carefully about the personal data you will collect and why it is essential to your research question. Otherwise, maybe you do not need to collect that piece of information at all.
- Working in teams: Consider the technical resources available across the collaborating organizations. Do partners have access to secure storage? Do partners have the software needed to open the data files that will be created? Will partners get support to procure and use the resources or software that will be used in the project?
- Make sure that your data is stored safely and securely, whether physically (e.g., in locked cabinets) or digitally (e.g., in folders that can only be accessed by authorised people). This includes ways to protect your data [against natural and man-made disasters (e.g., fires, floods, earthquakes), power failures, and tampering](https://www.infosec.ox.ac.uk/physical-and-environmental#tab-450151).
- Make sure that your electronic devices and onlines accounts are secure by installing the latest security updates, [using strong passwords (and use two-factor authentication where possible), and being alert to hacking and phishing scams](https://www.infosec.ox.ac.uk/make-my-online-accounts-secure#tab-444596). It also goes without saying that you should take care not to physically misplace or lose your devices. 
- Be organized with your files. Have clear methods of naming data files and folders and identifying different versions of the same file. It should be easy for somebody else to use and access.
- Think about how you will store data in the short-term and long-term. It is a good idea to have multiple copies of data in secure and robust storage systems. Relying only on laptops, computer hard drives, and external hard drives can be risky. For long-term storage, look into different repositories available and any costs associated with archiving data there. Examples are the [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/) and [Figshare](https://figshare.com/).
- Select any cloud-based storage services carefully and check for compliance with relevant policies in your organisation or legal jurisdiction. For example, universities in the UK and the European Union may be selective in the platforms they use in order to follow GDPR data processing requirements. Use only trusted and approved service providers for your research data.
- Working in teams: Identify members of the team who will be responsible for overseeing data management or specific data management duties in every organization involved (if working collaboratively).
- Intellectual property: When planning your research, especially for research that will be archived for public access, also consider if you own the intellectual property for all the materials you want to archive. Make sure that you are legally allowed to reuse or report these materials.

### Data breaches

Examples of incidents that could put the safety and confidentiality of your data are:

- lost or stolen laptops or mobile devices
- hacked e-mail or online accounts
- viruses, keyloggers, and other malware in your computer or computer network
- unauthorised access to your organisation's servers or IT systems

Check with your research team or organisation if you have a policy for reporting possible data breaches. Even if you don't, it is always a good idea to talk to your supervisor or research team for guidance on what to do next. For example, there may be an option to remote wipe data from lost laptops or mobile devices, or to recover hacked accounts with stronger protections. The IT department of your organisation may also be able to help.

Under the GDPR, there is a [requirement to report personal data breaches within 72 hours of knowing about it](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/personal-data-breaches/). Check if your research team or organisation for similar requirements that may apply to you.

### Conclusion

As you can see, research integrity and ethics covers every stage of the research process. It requires good working knowledge of the latest professional and ethical standards in research, including the use of technologies to process data securely. It also requires the extensive planning and documentation of procedures and protocols that work for all individuals and organisations involved in the research project, whether it's a student project or a multi-year international collaboration like TalkTogether.

There may be a lot of information to digest now but applying these research integrity and ethics principles can make your research more intentional, reliable, and trustworthy overall.
