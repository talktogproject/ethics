## Storing, Analysing, and Archiving Your Data

As part of our research, we are creating, encoding, storing, analysing, and archiving data about individuals. This comes with the responsibility to maintain their privacy and to use data about them in a fair and responsible way. In the United Kingdom and the European Union, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) provides a legal framework for doing so. We will use GDPR-related terminology in this section; however, we think that researchers from non-EU countries can also think about how these regulations apply to their local areas. 

The kind of research we do often involves the processing of _personal data_.

> Personal data is information which relates to aliving individual who can be identified from that information,  whether  directly  or  indirectly,  and  in  particular  by  reference  to  an  identifier. 

This includes a person's:
- name
- identification number
- location data
- online identifier (e.g., IP address)

The GPDR also considers certain types of data to be especially private and leaves participants to potential discrimination. These include data about a person's:
- racial or ethnic origin
- political opinions
- religious or philosophical beliefs
- trade union membership
- genetic data
- biometric data (for unique identification)
- health
- sex life
- sexuality

Extra care is needed for these _special category personal data_.

### Anonymous and pseudonymous data

The purpose of anonymising datasets is to ensure that a participant cannot be re-identified based on the data they supplied. Typically, researchers assign participant IDs and remove obvious identifiers such as names, addresses, and contact details from datasets to achieve this. While many researchers find this process sufficient, full anonymisation is difficult to achieve. We often collect additional data that makes it easier to trace data back to an individual, such as age, regional origin, and medical condition. In reality, most of the typical research practice is considered _pseudonymisation_, which disguises the participants' identities and makes it a bit harder to retrace.

Some practices for responsible pseudonymisation:
- Make sure that datasets only contain participant IDs. The list linking participant IDs with participants' names and contact details must be kept separately
- Store the list securely using password protection and/or by storing lists in locked cabinets
- Do not share the above list with anyone outside the research team

Audio or video recorded data present additional challenges. Participants might reveal personal information about themselves or other people during the recording. Additionally, participants' voices and faces make them more readily identifiable than pen and paper or questionnaire-based data collection methods. The CHILDES database lists [different levels of data access for audio and video data](https://talkbank.org/share/irb/options.html). This includes audio bleeping, video blurring, and the replacement of last names and addresses in transcripts. Importantly, research involving photo, audio, or video recordings should have consent forms that explicitly ask for participants' agreement for these recordings to be made and used for specified purposes. You can access a [sample template at the University of Oxford website](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/files/writtenconsentformtemplatedocx).

### Data protection principles

When processing personal data, it is important to adhere to the following data protection principles:

| Data protection principle | Description |
| -------|-------|
| Fair, lawful, and transparent data processing | Researchers must be clear about who will process or view their data (including the transfer of data outside the European Economic Area), for what purpose(s) and for how long. Participants must also be aware of their right to withdraw consent at any time |
| The data is collected for specific, explicit, and legitimate purposes | Personal data collected for a specific purpose should NOT be used for something else, unless there is consent for the new purpose. The use of personal data for other research is usually exempted from this principle |
| The data collected and processed is no more than is necessary for the research | This discourages researchers from collecting more personal information than is necessary. Even within research teams, it is possible that not all members of the research team require access to the non-anonymised dataset to carry out their research duties |
| Personal data is accurate and up-to-date (if needed) | Inaccurate data must be corrected or deleted without delay. Researchers are normally interested in a person's situation at a particular point in time; as such, there may be no need to update the information in the future |
| Identifiable data is destroyed when no longer needed | It is good practice to specify a suitable time when participant lists are destroyed, normally towards the end of the research project period |
| Personal data is processed securely | Secure processing means that only authorised people can access and process personal data and within the scope of their duties, and that lost personal data can still be recovered if accidentally lost or destroyed. This means that there should be appropriate technological resources, organisational measures, and staff training in place for processing personal data securely |

For collaborations that involve the sharing and transfer of data between different organizations, it is good practice to draw up a written agreement (called a 'data sharing agreement') to specify the roles and responsbilities of each organization in relation to data processing.

### Having a research data management plan

Some grant and ethics applications require a research data management plan, or a xxxx. Even if your institution, funding agency, or ethics committee do not require one, it is a good starting point for thinking about the type of data you're collecting, how they are organised, stored, archived, and shared, and what ethical and legal issues need to be considered. The Digital Curation Centre provides a [checklist for creating a data management plan for your project](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/resource/DMP/DMP_Checklist_2013.pdf).
