## Storing, Analysing, and Archiving Your Data

As part of our research, we are creating, encoding, storing, analysing, and archiving data about individuals. This comes with the responsibility to maintain their privacy and to use data about them in a fair and responsible way. In the UK and the European Union, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) provides a legal framework for doing so. We will use GDPR-related terminology in this section; however, we think that researchers from non-EU countries can also think about how these regulations apply to their local areas. 

The kind of research we do often involves the processing of _personal data_.

> Personal data is information which relates to aliving individual who can be identified from that information,  whether  directly  or  indirectly,  and  in  particular  by  reference  to  an  identifier. 

This includes a person's:
- name
- identification number
- location data
- online identifier (e.g., IP address)
- individual characteristics (e.g., physical, physiological, genetic, cultural, social)

### Anonymous and pseudonymous data

The purpose of anonymising data is to ensure that a participant cannot be re-identified based on the data they supplied. Typically, researchers assign participant IDs and omit obvious identifiers such as names, addresses, and contact details from datasets to achieve this. While many researchers find this process sufficient, full anonymisation is difficult to achieve. We often collect additional data that makes it easier to trace data back to an individual, such as age, regional origin, and medical condition. In reality, most of the typical research practice is considered _pseudonymisation_, which disguises the participants' identities and makes it a bit harder to retrace.

Some practices for responsible pseudonymisation:
- Make sure that datasets only contain participant IDs. The list linking participant IDs with participants' names and contact details must be kept separately
- Store the list securely using password protection and/or by storing lists in locked cabinets
- Do not share the above list with anyone outside the research team

Audio or video recorded data present additional challenges. Participants might reveal personal information about themselves or other people during the recording. Additionally, participants' voices and faces make them more readily identifiable than pen and paper or questionnaire-based data collection methods. The CHILDES database lists [different levels of data access for audio and video data](https://talkbank.org/share/irb/options.html). This includes audio bleeping, video blurring, and the replacement of last names and addresses in transcripts. Importantly, research involving photo, audio, or video recordings should have consent forms that explicitly ask for participants' agreement for these recordings to be made and used for specified purposes. You can access a [sample template at the University of Oxford website](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/files/writtenconsentformtemplatedocx).

### Having a research data management plan

Some grant and ethics applications require a research data management plan, or a xxxx. Even if your institution or funding agency does not require one, it is also a good idea

### Data storage

Storing consent forms and participant lists

Anonymising datasets

### Audio and video data

This is trickier in the case of audio and video data, where a participants' voice or face can provide a lot of information about the participants' identity.

### Data privacy

The GDPR laws applicable in the UK and Europe are specific about

- Data controller vs. xxx

- Personal and sensitive information

### Data breaches

### Data analysis and publishing

### Data archiving
