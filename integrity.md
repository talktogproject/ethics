## Research Integrity

Being an ethical researcher is not only about:
- Submitting an ethics form
- Making participants sign a consent form

It is about conducting research that is scientifically rigorous and trustworthy. This is captured very well by the quote below:

> The scientific enterprise is built on a foundation of trust. Society trusts that scientific research results are an honest and accurate reflection of a researcher’s work. Researchers equally trust that their colleagues have gathered data carefully, have used appropriate analytic and statistical techniques, have reported their results accurately, and have treated the work of other researchers with respect.

### Commitment to high standards of research integrity

* Honesty, rigour, transparency, accountability, e.g. reporting research misconduct
* Having clear policies & systems for ethics training & evaluating research, e.g. funders, institutions, professional organizations, research teams, and individual researchers are all responsible
Following appropriate ethical, legal and professional frameworks, obligations, and standards, e.g. following relevant data protection laws (e.g. GDPR)

### What can go wrong? Examples of research misconduct
* Data fabrication/falsification/misrepresentation
* Intellectual property violations (e.g. plagiarism)
* Poor collaboration (e.g. authorship disputes)
* Undisclosed conflicts of interest

3. For collaborations between researchers in the Global North and Global South, it’s especially important to ensure that research is done equitably between partners
