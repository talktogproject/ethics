## Research Integrity

Being an ethical researcher is not only about:
* Submitting an ethics form
* Making participants sign a consent form

It is about conducting research that is scientifically rigorous and trustworthy, as captured by the quote below:

> The scientific enterprise is built on a foundation of trust. Society trusts that scientific research results are an honest and accurate reflection of a researcher’s work. Researchers equally trust that their colleagues have gathered data carefully, have used appropriate analytic and statistical techniques, have reported their results accurately, and have treated the work of other researchers with respect.

*On Being a Scientist: A Guide to Responsible Conduct in Research (2009), Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy*

Researchers should then:

* be aware of existing laws, codes of practice, policies, and publication rules in their field
* gain the necessary skills and training (including ethics training) applicable to their field
* take initiative in asking questions or raising concerns when issues arise
* be transparent and accountable to their peers and their organization

*adapted from the [University of Oxford Research Integrity Leaflet](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/researchsupport/documents/media/research_integrityv6_web.pdf)*

The responsibility to uphold research integrity rests not only on the individual researcher, but also on their colleagues, collaborators, universities and organizations, funding agencies, and the wider scientific community.

### Something to think about:

Does your team, organization, academic field, and/or funder have clear policies and systems for:
* Obtaining ethics clearance
* Training researchers in ethics and study protocols
* Reporting changes in research protocols
* Reporting research misconduct
* Monitoring and evaluating progress in your research project

Did you say 'yes' to all of the above? Do you know who is responsible for each of the points above? If not, then it is good to look for more information within your team, organization, or research field.

For example, here are ways that research integrity is upheld in the TalkTogether team at different levels:

**Within the research team**
* Training for ethics and study protocols are co-developed and conducted by members of the TalkTogether team (including this training course).
* We have regular meetings and milestones meetings within the research team.
* We create extensive written documentation of our study protocols and key decisions made by the research team, with a goal to produce tools and protocols for public use.

**Within our organizations and academic institutions**
* We obtain ethics clearance from each of the institutions involved. Currently, they are The Promise Foundation's ethics committee, and an ad-hoc ethics committee for the University of the Philippines - Diliman, and the [University of Oxford's CUREC](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/governance/ethics).
* Changes in the research protocol, if any, should be raised with the same ethics committees listed above.
* The University of Oxford provides [guidance on how to report research misconduct through multiple channels](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/governance/integrity/misconduct#collapse390836).

**With funding agencies**
* We submit regular reports to our research funder UKRI for monitoring and evaluation. We have reported changes to the research programme as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
* Our funders ESRC & UKRI publish their own frameworks for [research integrity](https://www.ukri.org/our-work/supporting-healthy-research-and-innovation-culture/research-integrity/) and [research ethics](https://esrc.ukri.org/funding/guidance-for-applicants/research-ethics/).

**With the wider academic community**
* We engage and will continue to engage with academic peers and practitioners through conferences, working groups, roundtable discussions, and peer reviewed publications.
* We invite external academics, practitioners, and stakeholders to review our protocols and outputs.

### Why the fuss? What can go wrong?

Examples of research misconduct
* Data fabrication/falsification/misrepresentation
* Intellectual property violations (e.g. plagiarism)
* Poor collaboration (e.g. authorship disputes)
* Undisclosed conflicts of interest

(according to...)

Research misconduct does not only occur because of malicious and devious intent.

Mistakes and lapses happen in research projects. What matters is how you respond when they occur. It is always best to be honest, transparent, and accountable.

### When research goes global

For collaborations between researchers in the Global North and Global South, it’s especially important to ensure that research is done equitably between partners
