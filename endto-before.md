## Before Data Collection

**Planning your research study**



**Submitting an ethics application**

1. **Know the ethics requirements in your organization(s) or research site(s)**

- *Know who to submit the application(s) to.* In some cases, local requirements might require that a researcher should secure university ethics clearance first, then also secure ethics clearance with a government or state-level agency. This means that the entire ethics application process can take months to complete. 
- *Ethics across international partners.* In international collaborations, the best practice is to secure ethics clearance with all partners conducting the research. To avoid [ethics dumping](integrity-global.md), it is important to secure ethics clearance from local research committees. This is not always possible or feasible; for example, in the case of student research projects or when there are no local ethics committees available in the research area. The best practice is to coordinate with local communities or experts to vouch for the soundness and cultural appropriateness of the research protocols.  
- *Be early.* Be aware of submission deadlines and how long it takes for ethics committees to process your application. Ethics committees could meet every month, every few months, or when necessary or needed (as in the case of ad hoc committees). The situation varies in every institution and there can be periods in time when committees receive a higher number of submissions than usual.

Poor planning can result in a breach of ethics. It is important to remember that (1) **data collection should not begin before ethics approval is secured** and (2) **ethics approval should not be sought retroactively or after a study has been completed**.
