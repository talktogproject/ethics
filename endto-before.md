## Before Data Collection

### **Planning your research study**

The best way to ensure that a study is carried out with the highest standards of research integrity and ethics is to have a clear research plan. A clear research plan is informed by a review of the literature, identifies specific research questions, and lays out a plan for answering these questions. Researchers have many opportunities to write down their research plan. It can be part of a grant application, a thesis proposal (for students), a preregistration or registered report, a research ethics application, or even two or more of the aforementioned documents.

Some things that researchers should think about during their planning are:
- Research aims and objectives
- Existing work that they are building their work upon
- Justification for doing the research
- Research questions, hypotheses, and expected outcomes 
- Methods that will be used
- Timelines and milestones
- Budgets, resources, and manpower needed
- Approvals needed before conducting the research

### **Securing ethics clearance**

Poor planning can result in a breach of ethics. It is important to remember that (1) data collection should not begin before ethics approval is secured and (2) ethics approval should not be sought retroactively or after a study has been completed.

1. **Know the ethics requirements in your organization(s) or research site(s)**

- *Know which ethics committees are involved.* Members of the ethics committee should be independent of the researcher or research team and should be individuals with the appropriate knowledge of how research is conducted. In some cases, local requirements might require that a researcher should secure university ethics clearance first, then also secure ethics clearance with a government or state-level agency. This means that the entire ethics application process can take months to complete. 
- *Ethics across international partners.* In international collaborations, the best practice is to secure ethics clearance with all partners conducting the research. To avoid [ethics dumping](integrity-global.md), it is important to secure ethics clearance from local research committees. This is not always possible or feasible; for example, in the case of student research projects or when there are no local ethics committees available in the research area. The best practice is to coordinate with local communities or experts to vouch for the soundness and cultural appropriateness of the research protocols.  
- *Know what kind of ethics application should be made.* Many institutions differentiate between ethics applications that qualify for a quicker application process if the research qualifies as 'minimal risk'. For research with children, institutions normally require a 'full review' as they are considered a 'vulnerable group'.
- *Be early.* Be aware of submission deadlines and how long it takes for ethics committees to process your application. Ethics committees could meet every month, every few months, or when necessary or needed (as in the case of ad hoc committees). The situation varies in every institution and there can be periods in time when committees receive a higher number of submissions than usual.

#### How this supports the BPS ethics principle of _scientific integrity_ and _social responsibility_
Securing ethics approval is a way to show that your study had been evaluated by impartial reviewers and that your study design falls within acceptable research practices. Seeking approval from a local research committee in a low- to middle-income country also ensures that the study protocol had been judged as appropriate by experts or community leaders who are familiar with the laws and cultural norms in the community or country being studied.

2. **Prepare your ethics application**

Different ethics committees have different requirements. Typically, ethics committees may ask researchers to fill up an application form containing details of the research team, the research aims and objectives, the study protocol, and samples of the measures to be used.

- *Informed consent*

The ultimate goal is for participants to _understand_ what the study is about, what is being asked from them, and what their rights are as participants. Written participant recruitment and information materials should be written in plain language and in a language understood by the participant. When research is conducted among communities with low literacy or where paper records are viewed with suspicion or even as a safety threat, researchers can explain the study orally.

As with the recruitment and participant information materials, consent is normally obtained in written form. However, in certain cases, consent might be taken orally with an audio recorder or with a researcher record of oral consent. Whatever the case may be, there should be a document to show that a participant had agreed to join the study.
