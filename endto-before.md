## Planning Your Study

### **Writing a research plan**

The best way to ensure that a study is carried out with the highest standards of research integrity and ethics is to have a clear research plan. A clear research plan is informed by a review of the literature, identifies specific research questions, and lays out a plan for answering these questions. Researchers have many opportunities to write down their research plan. It can be part of a grant application, a thesis proposal (for students), a preregistration or registered report, a research ethics application, or even two or more of the aforementioned documents.

Some things that researchers should think about during their planning are:
- Research aims and objectives
- Existing work that they are building their work upon
- Justification for doing the research
- Research questions, hypotheses, and expected outcomes 
- Methods that will be used
- How research data will be stored and managed
- Timelines and milestones
- Budgets, resources, and manpower needed
- Approvals needed before conducting the research
- Alternative plans in case things do not go as planned

A good research plan demonstrates that the study is well-planned, well-designed, and achievable. It shows that the researcher is knowledgeable about the topic and has the skills and resources needed to carry out the study responsibly and successfully.

### **Securing ethics clearance**

Even researchers with great ideas and good intentions might not realize that they forgot something or have something wrong with their plan. Therefore it is important that an independent committee reviews what a researcher is planning to do. Any research that involves recruiting human participants to answer questions, perform tasks, or be observed (including recording on audio or video) require ethics approval.

Here are some steps that a responsible researcher would normally take to get ethics approval:

1. **Knowing the ethics requirements in their organization(s) or research site(s)**

- *Know which ethics committees are involved.* Members of the ethics committee should be independent of the researcher or research team and should be individuals with the appropriate knowledge of how research is conducted. In some cases, local requirements might require that a researcher should secure university ethics clearance first, then also secure ethics clearance with a government or state-level agency. This means that the entire ethics application process can take months to complete. 
- *Ethics across international partners.* In international collaborations, the best practice is to secure ethics clearance with all partners conducting the research. To avoid [ethics dumping](integrity-global.md), it is important to secure ethics clearance from local research committees. This is not always possible; for example, in the case of student research projects or when there are no local ethics committees available in the research area. The best practice is to coordinate with local communities or experts to vouch for the soundness and cultural appropriateness of the research protocols.  
- *Know what kind of ethics application should be made.* Many institutions differentiate between ethics applications that qualify for a quicker application process if the research qualifies as 'minimal risk'. For research with children, institutions normally require a 'full review' as they are considered a 'vulnerable group'.

Securing ethics approval is a way to show that your study had been evaluated by objective reviewers and that your study design falls within acceptable research practices. Seeking approval from a local research committee in a low- to middle-income country also ensures that the study protocol had been judged as appropriate by experts or community leaders who are familiar with the laws and cultural norms in the community or country being studied.

2. **Preparing your ethics application**

Different ethics committees have different requirements. Typically, ethics committees may ask researchers to fill up an application form containing details of who is in the research team, the research aims and objectives, who will be recruited (and how), the study protocol, and samples of the materials to be used. Some important documents that may be included are:

- *Participant information sheet*

The ultimate goal is for participants to _understand_ what the study is about, what is being asked from them, and what their rights are as participants. Some essential informationa include:

##### What the study is about
* The aim(s) of the study
* The data to be collected
* How it will be collected
* How much time it will take to participate in the study
##### Participants' rights
* The right to refuse to provide any particular information requested
* The right to withdraw at any time with no negative consequences
* The right to have any data destroyed upon request (until a certain date)
* Assurance that any information shared will be kept confidential
##### What will be done with the data gathered
* How data will be used and planned outcomes
##### Risks and benefits of participating in the research
* Any reimbursement or compensation to be given to participants
* Potential benefits of the research
##### How to contact the research team
* Names and details of the principal investigator and/or a contact person for questions or complaints

- *Informed consent and/or assent*

Consent forms are usually written documents that adult participants sign for themselves or on their children's behalf. 
**Consent is gained from adults. Assent**

These documents should be written in simple language and in a language understood by the participant. When research is conducted among communities with low literacy or where paper records are viewed with suspicion or even as a safety threat, researchers should consider alternative ways of providing information, such as sharing the information orally. However, in certain cases, consent might be taken orally with an audio recorder or with a researcher record of oral consent. However, some ethics committees or local authorities might be very strict with their requirements. For example, some might only accept written consent forms or require additional signatures in them. Make sure that you know what they require and plan your research accordingly.

Many universities have templates for participant information sheets and consent forms that you could freely download; for example, here is a website where you can find English language templates used at [The University of Oxford](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/governance/ethics/resources/consent#collapse281101). Check if your research group, organization, or ethics committee have required or preferred templates. Also, don't forget to plan for the time and effort it takes to write these materials in the participants' or communities' local language(s).

3. **Submitting your ethics application**

It is important to remember that (1) data collection should not begin before ethics approval is received and (2) ethics approval should not be sought retroactively or after a study has been completed. To avoid any issues, be aware of submission deadlines and how long it takes for ethics committees to process your application. Ethics committees could meet every month, every few months, or when necessary or needed (as in the case of ad hoc committees). The situation varies in every institution and there can be periods in time when committees receive a higher number of submissions than usual.

In the best case scenario, the ethics committee will approve your study and you may begin collecting data. In some cases, the ethics committee might send feedback or request revisions before they give formal approval. In the worst case scenario, the ethics application is rejected and the researcher needs to start all over again. It is really important to plan your research extensively and prepare a well-written and well-justified ethics application. 

### Changes in research protocol

Unfortunately, it is possible that things might not go as planned.
